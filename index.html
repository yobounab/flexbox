        <p>New York City is the perfect city to photograph. Its diverse architecture and people make it all the more special.</p>
        <p>As I was still getting to know the city, it was fun to take a picture of things and people that I encountered everywhere I went. You can follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/Lens.eur/">Instagram.</a></p>

            <p>I was on the Wall-Street-bound ferry when I took this picture. The moment the ferry went under the Manhattan Bridge made it perfect as the bridge filled the space in the background.</p>

            <p>This one is a little out of focus, but its actual state holds a meaning. This is my friend's cat, Little E, and the day after I took this photo he went back to China. A picture of him "fading away" couldn't be more accurate </p>
